# Project 
This directory contains my Licence 2 **Craps project** in C.


The project consists in remaking the craps game with a few modified rules (the game is then called **NiceCraps**).  
The game has a high-score table and retains players who have played before.  

Craps base rules: https://www.venetianlasvegas.com/resort/casino/table-games/craps-basic-rules.html  

## How to run it : 
Download [the executable](/NiceCraps.exe) and enjoy !! (Everything is in command line display)
